# CarDriver2D
A simple game to help me get familiar with Unity. 
The ideal project should be:
A car driving around gathering collectibles like: Speed Up, Changing colors, etc

Update: For now the project only has a car and a tree to test collision and trigger. Currently on hold so I can move on to the new project.
